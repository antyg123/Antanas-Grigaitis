                <p>When I am not coding, I enjoy writing in my blog called "The existentialist." This blog contains my philosophical insights. Each piece is structured around an argument backed by personal experience.</p>
                <p>I went on to play University Volleyball at the University of WInnipeg for three years while studying a variety of subjects, one of which being computer science. I failed programming believe it or not, feeling as though the methods used to teach in school did not fit my persnal learning style. After leaving University, I travelled WEstern Canada, picking up varies jobs along the way inlucing tree planting in backcountry BC and Landscaping in rural okanagon. </p>
                <p>I went on to travel across the world to New Zealand, continueing my travels and documenting my trip using a camera I have purchased prior to leaving. I took advantage of my skill with a camera and went on to become a freelance video producer and video editor for a small produciton company in Wellington. Once again, my path changed. I hit the road again, and the next time I stopped I rekindled my passion for development and discovered an intence pull towards long distane running.</p>
